# shark-in-the-wires

Capture packets. Light up LEDs. Put LEDs on a shark. 

This code drives the LEDs on a wire sculpture I made for [Dublin Maker](http://dublinmaker.ie). I wrote a [blog post](https://machineperson.github.io/hardware/2018/09/19/wireshark-project.html) including photos and a write up of how I built the sculpture.
